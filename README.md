# Trading Result Analysis

This project provides a Python-based analysis of trading results from a CSV file. The goal is to calculate key performance metrics and visualize the trading performance to identify strengths, weaknesses, and overall profitability.

## 📈 Dashboard / Key Visualizations

*(Note: It is highly recommended to add a screenshot of your most important chart here, like an equity curve or a profit/loss chart. Name the image file `equity_curve.png` or something similar and upload it to your repository.)*

## 🚀 Key Performance Metrics Analyzed

This analysis calculates several key trading performance indicators, including:

* **Total Profit/Loss (P&L):** The net outcome of all trades.
* **Win Rate:** The percentage of trades that were profitable.
* **Profit Factor:** The gross profit divided by the gross loss. A value greater than 1 indicates a profitable system.
* **Average Win & Average Loss:** The average amount gained on winning trades versus the amount lost on losing trades.
* **Max Drawdown:** The largest peak-to-trough decline in the trading account's equity.
* **Sharpe Ratio:** (Optional) A measure of risk-adjusted return.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
    * **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
    * **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.
    * **Jupyter Notebook:** (if applicable) For interactive analysis and presentation.

## ⚙️ How to Use This Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed.
* Jupyter Notebook (if you used a `.ipynb` file).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mohit3478/Trading_result_analysis.git](https://github.com/mohit3478/Trading_result_analysis.git)
    cd Trading_result_analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    *(Important: Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project by running this command in your terminal: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Then upload that file to GitHub.)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Data Format

The analysis script expects a `.csv` file with your trading data. The file should contain columns similar to the following:

* `entry_date`
* `exit_date`
* `ticker`
* `direction` (e.g., 'LONG' or 'SHORT')
* `entry_price`
* `exit_price`
* `quantity`

*(Please update the list above to match the exact columns in your data file!)*

### Running the Analysis

1.  Place your trading data file (e.g., `my_trades.csv`) in the root directory.
2.  Update the script/notebook to read from your file name.
3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the analysis and generate the visualizations.
