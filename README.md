# Trading Result Analysis in Python

This project analyzes a set of trading results using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis is performed in the `Trading Results Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to calculate key performance metrics and visualize trading performance.

## üìä Key Visualizations

The primary goal is to visualize the trading account's performance. The notebook generates several plots, including:

* **Equity Curve:** A chart showing the growth of the trading account over time.
* **Profit/Loss (P&L) Distribution:** A histogram showing the frequency of different profit and loss amounts.
* **[Add other plots here]:** (e.g., Drawdown chart, P&L by day of week, etc.)

*(**Your action:** Run your notebook, take screenshots of your charts, and add them to the `img` folder. Then, link one here like this:)*

## üöÄ Key Performance Metrics

The analysis script calculates the following metrics to evaluate the trading strategy:

* **Total Profit/Loss:** The net result of all trades.
* **Win Rate:** The percentage of profitable trades.
* **Average Win / Average Loss:** The average profit on winning trades vs. the average loss on losing trades.
* **Profit Factor:** Total profits divided by total losses.
* **[Add other metrics here]:** (e.g., Max Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, etc. Look in your notebook for what you calculated.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Pandas (for data manipulation)
    * Matplotlib (for plotting)
    * (Add any other libraries you used, like `numpy` or `seaborn`)
